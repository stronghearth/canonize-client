## App Description

Description from About Link: Stories of all kinds start with those who live within your world. When you register with Canonize, you can make a record of all the characters who live in your story, whether they each have a full profile or just exist in a brief note. Once many characters become a part of your Canon, you can easily find individuals and expand your notes on them if you wish. Canonize is a great tool for fiction writers and tabletop role-playing game masters alike.

Newly registered/logged in canonize users will land on an empty page with a link to an Add Character form, once a few characters are added, a list of characters to the right emerges with the latest character showing in an expanded view to the left.

A user can select a name from the list on the right and change which character is shown in the expanded view. There is also a search feature in the client that can narrow the list of characters down by name. 

![EditCharacter](/src/images/Screenshot 5.png)

In the expanded character view, a user can access an Edit Character form, which once saved, the expanded character and the list of characters automatically update. A user can alsodelete a character from their record within the expanded character view.
